# SecondWebpage
This webpage will be expanding on the lessons learnt over the last few months. The first webpage was very basic and was more to experiment with some simple techniques.

Features intended to be added on this page and learning opportunities: 

- More clean and professional visually
- Tidy title bar
- Navigation tabs
- Links to other pages on website
- Responsive to different screen sizes
- Use of grid/flex boxes to hold content
- Use of Hover effects
- Consideration of Calls To Action / Drawing    attention to certain elements
- Use of css pseudo-elements
- Experiment with clickable icons
- Learn about copyright-free material and attribution requirements
- Buttons and input fields



Reflection:

Went well:
- Nav bar links to other pages are good/work/relatively good aesthetically
- Product page has best CTAs so far

To consider for next time:
- should have defined style of basic html elements in css earlier to avoid duplication/confusion
- need more practice with flexbox/grid to get desirded packing
- need to look more into attribution of content laws/requirements
